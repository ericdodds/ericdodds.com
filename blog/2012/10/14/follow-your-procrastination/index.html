<div class="entry-content"><p>A few years ago my friend posted a quote about procrastination:</p>

<blockquote><p>The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life. <strong>â€“Jessica Hische</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Upon first read the concept was interesting, but it&rsquo;s full weight didn&rsquo;t hit me until much later. I think the delayed reaction was due to my professional youth &ndash; at the time I was earning spurs on my first national brand and consuming knowledge from my veteran boss like a dry sponge. The specificity of the industry (marketing) was far less important to me than the unique opportunities I had to carry more responsibility than normal for my age.</p>

<p>After a good while, though, my rate of absorption began to slow. As a wise man <a href="http://gim.ie/5CIK">once said</a>, &ldquo;<em>in this department of life, as in every other, thrills come at the beginning and do not last.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I still thoroughly enjoyed my day-to-day responsibilities, a flattened learning curve afforded me more time to expand my reading and thinking about marketing, business, and more. Interestingly, my curiosity led me mostly towards the internet, technology, and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Hacker News and WIRED became regular reads, I began grabbing lunch with startup addicts like <a href="http://doddcaldwell.com">Dodd Caldwell</a>. I even started teaching myself basic HTML.</p>

<p>I also channeled my off-hours energy (and learning) into attempts to start a few companies. I began to scan my day-to-day experiences for annoyances or problems that I thought technology could iron out. At the time, I also happened to live with one of the most talented developers I&rsquo;ve ever met, and he was happy for a few new challenges to tackle.</p>

<p>In about a years&#8217; time, we both began and killed a rental payment web app and a wedding website service. (It was awesomely deflating to see Wordpress release a <a href="http://weddings.wordpress.com">phenomenal wedding product</a> not too long after we started writing code.)</p>

<p>Around that same time a friend told me that he heard about an extra volunteer spot at a sold-out conference called <a href="http://grok.cc">GROK</a>. I knew that some of the brightest minds in the country gather there to talk about technology, design, and the internet, so I was thrilled to take him up.</p>

<p>GROK did two very important things for me: First, it fully confirmed my passion for the industry, giving me clear direction for my next career move.</p>

<p>Second, it introduced me to a few gentleman named <a href="http://matthewsmith.cc">Matthew Smith</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/peterbarth">Peter Barth</a>, who would later provide the opportunity for that career move.</p>

<p>In different spheres, both had been forging a foundation of design and technology in the Upstate, Matthew through gathering some of the top talent in the nation and forming <a href="http://coworkgreenville.com">CoWork</a>, and Peter through a startup accelerator called The Next Big Thing.</p>

<p>When our paths crossed at GROK, it just so happens that they were talking about combining forces to form a single organization that shared resources, collaboration, and talent to better position our community as the place for all things tech in the Southeast.</p>

<p>It also just so happens that they needed another team member to manage both execution and promotion of their programs.</p>

<p>At that point, though, the merger was still an idea over lunch. But lunches turned into meetings, and meetings turned into branding work, and <a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a> was born, along with an offer for yours truly.</p>

<p>In November my procrastination will turn into my paycheck, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited.</p>
