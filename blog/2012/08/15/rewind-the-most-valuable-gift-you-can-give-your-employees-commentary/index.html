<div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I re-posted the very first article I wrote as a young and overly optimistic youth, freshly released into the bitter reality of life in a marketing agency. (Go back and <a href="http://ericdodds.com/rewind-the-most-valuable-gift-you-can-give-your-employees/">have a read</a> if you like.)</p>

<p>Today I said that I would share what I hope is mature, growth-inspired commentary. Again, no promises.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, 22-year-old Eric, article really isn&rsquo;t too shabby. You&rsquo;d be glad to know that I still wholeheartedly believe that freedom to fail is an incredible asset to employees.</p>

<p>Both supervisors I&rsquo;ve had at Brains on Fire have, I believe, helped me learn more quickly than I would have at other places by letting me try to climb hills too big for my age and title when I asked.</p>

<p><em>A few thoughts:</em></p>

<p>First of all, I now have a direct report. I actually hired this person because they cold-called me, but that&rsquo;s another story for another time.</p>

<p>Not being responsible for myself and my work only has helped me see that the real utility in offering someone the chance to fail is in the learning. I do think the opportunity produces better work in the long run, but lessons learned in the process are as valuable, if not more, than the final product. Being a nice boss isn&rsquo;t that hard. Helping your team grow is tough, and doing the extra work of wading through the process of &lsquo;failure&rsquo; can be extremely demanding. It&rsquo;s also hard to ensure that individual failure doesn&rsquo;t compromise the quality (or timing) of what is delivered to the client or customer. In my experience, these challenges are worth the expense.</p>

<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve learned since writing the article is that implementing this concept company-wide is extremely difficult. Not many businesses have successfully scaled a culture that allows their employees &ndash; especially those on the front line &ndash; to take risks. And really, that is a question of scaling leadership. For most people at most work places, the best chance at offering people opportunity exists on their own teams. My good friend Jamie Plesser (who works at a giant corporation) <a href="http://kcslim.posterous.com/94532739">says it well</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now by doing this am I going to affect a sea change in the organization?  Likely not.  But I can make a difference for my team.  I can encourage them to take charge and own their own time.  Plus I can push others in the company to reevaluate [long-standing inefficient processes].</p></blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, many in leadership positions seem to view this process (and work) of employee growth as additional to the work &lsquo;they already have to do.&rsquo; Hogwash. I believe that if you are in a position of leadership, the growth and development of the people you lead is one of your foremost responsibilities, and, really, privileges. If not, you&rsquo;re simply a manager.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>That was a fun look back, and it almost seems like there&rsquo;s some learning in all of that pontification. I just might find another old article to post here soon. </em></p>
