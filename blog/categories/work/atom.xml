    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am the official Washer of Dishes in the Dodds household. Most every night before bed and every morning before I leave for work, I scrub, spray and wipe so that our kitchen is ready for the next meal.</p>

<p>Before we were married and lived in the same house, my wife and I had a great talk about who would be responsible for which chores, and I told her that I wanted to do the dishes because I enjoyed the job.</p>

<p>A few months into marriage my wife asked me an interesting question: &ldquo;I appreciate that you do the dishes all of the time, and I know that you said you like it, but why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t something that I&rsquo;d put much thought into before, but the answer came easily.</p>

<p>I like to clean the kitchen because most other areas of my life are battles that bring both joy and difficulty, whether it&rsquo;s a job or a relationship or staying in shape. Most will last as long as I&rsquo;m alive. All exhaust me at times. Doing the dishes is one of a few things that I can take care of completely—perfectly—in about 20 minutes (most nights). It&rsquo;s tactical, and every time I rub a drying cloth and put a dish away I can literally feel myself making progress.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong—I don&rsquo;t jump up and down at the chance to wield a fresh scrub brush. In fact, most times after a long day there are things I&rsquo;d much rather do than face the carnage of a hardware-heavy meal. But I <em>do</em> find deep satisfaction in starting and finishing a project quickly and flawlessly, even if the process isn&rsquo;t fun.</p>

<p>It turns out this process is really good for your brain because of something called Implicit Memory.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote><p>Implicit memory is a type of memory in which previous experiences aid in the performance of a task without conscious awareness of these previous experiences. Evidence for implicit memory arises in priming, a process whereby subjects are measured by how they have improved their performance on tasks for which they have been subconsciously prepared.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s utility in consistently feeling tangible progress and completeness, even if it&rsquo;s in something as simple as doing the dishes—especially if you don&rsquo;t feel like doing it. That small, low-cost push to wipe the stovetop eventually bleeds over into that project at work that needs that last 10% to go from good to awesome, or that special thing you&rsquo;ve been planning to do for someone that you can&rsquo;t seem to get around to.</p>

<p>Rewarding yourself with a scotch when you&rsquo;re done doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago my friend posted a quote about procrastination:</p>

<blockquote><p>The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life. <strong>–Jessica Hische</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Upon first read the concept was interesting, but it&rsquo;s full weight didn&rsquo;t hit me until much later. I think the delayed reaction was due to my professional youth &ndash; at the time I was earning spurs on my first national brand and consuming knowledge from my veteran boss like a dry sponge. The specificity of the industry (marketing) was far less important to me than the unique opportunities I had to carry more responsibility than normal for my age.</p>

<p>After a good while, though, my rate of absorption began to slow. As a wise man <a href="http://gim.ie/5CIK">once said</a>, &ldquo;<em>in this department of life, as in every other, thrills come at the beginning and do not last.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I still thoroughly enjoyed my day-to-day responsibilities, a flattened learning curve afforded me more time to expand my reading and thinking about marketing, business, and more. Interestingly, my curiosity led me mostly towards the internet, technology, and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Hacker News and WIRED became regular reads, I began grabbing lunch with startup addicts like <a href="http://doddcaldwell.com">Dodd Caldwell</a>. I even started teaching myself basic HTML.</p>

<p>I also channeled my off-hours energy (and learning) into attempts to start a few companies. I began to scan my day-to-day experiences for annoyances or problems that I thought technology could iron out. At the time, I also happened to live with one of the most talented developers I&rsquo;ve ever met, and he was happy for a few new challenges to tackle.</p>

<p>In about a years' time, we both began and killed a rental payment web app and a wedding website service. (It was awesomely deflating to see Wordpress release a <a href="http://weddings.wordpress.com">phenomenal wedding product</a> not too long after we started writing code.)</p>

<p>Around that same time a friend told me that he heard about an extra volunteer spot at a sold-out conference called <a href="http://grok.cc">GROK</a>. I knew that some of the brightest minds in the country gather there to talk about technology, design, and the internet, so I was thrilled to take him up.</p>

<p>GROK did two very important things for me: First, it fully confirmed my passion for the industry, giving me clear direction for my next career move.</p>

<p>Second, it introduced me to a few gentleman named <a href="http://matthewsmith.cc">Matthew Smith</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/peterbarth">Peter Barth</a>, who would later provide the opportunity for that career move.</p>

<p>In different spheres, both had been forging a foundation of design and technology in the Upstate, Matthew through gathering some of the top talent in the nation and forming <a href="http://coworkgreenville.com">CoWork</a>, and Peter through a startup accelerator called The Next Big Thing.</p>

<p>When our paths crossed at GROK, it just so happens that they were talking about combining forces to form a single organization that shared resources, collaboration, and talent to better position our community as the place for all things tech in the Southeast.</p>

<p>It also just so happens that they needed another team member to manage both execution and promotion of their programs.</p>

<p>At that point, though, the merger was still an idea over lunch. But lunches turned into meetings, and meetings turned into branding work, and <a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a> was born, along with an offer for yours truly.</p>

<p>In November my procrastination will turn into my paycheck, and I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited.</p>
