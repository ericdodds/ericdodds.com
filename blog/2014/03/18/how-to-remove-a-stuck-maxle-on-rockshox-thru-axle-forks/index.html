<div class="entry-content"><p>This post is a bit &lsquo;off topic&rsquo; for the other content on my blog, so here&rsquo;s a brief explanation:</p>

<p><em>When I&rsquo;m not working on the Internet, I like to take on analog activities like going to the mountains or working in my shop. Mountain biking has long been a favorite thing to do, and because I do all of my own maintenance, satisfies my interest in both adventure and mechanical things.</em></p>

<p><em>I ran into a problem with my bike earlier this year and couldn&rsquo;t find a solution anywhere I looked. I took a gamble with some penetrating oil and a hammer and turned out to be right. This post is for everyone who has or will face the same frustration.</em></p>

<p>Not long ago I was changing the tires on my 2010 Specialized Pitch Pro. When I started to remove the Maxle from the Rockshox Pike (351) fork, it simply wouldn&rsquo;t come loose. Whenever I loosened it each side of the fork would spread apart—to the point where I thought I was going to break something.</p>

<p>I do 99% of the work on my bike, but I conceded and took her to a shop to get a second opinion. After a few days of fruitless fiddling, the mechanic told me that he called the manufacturer, who said that the parts needed to be cut off, meaning I would lose the fork. I wasn&rsquo;t happy.</p>

<p>Not satisfied, I turned back to the internet (which I had already scoured) and <a href="http://www.mtbpigs.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=1715.0">a forum post</a> that suggested:</p>

<blockquote><p>The inner races of the bearings will have rusted onto the maxle.  Mine has tried to do this in the past. WD40 is an obvious start point (if you haven&rsquo;t been there already) you need to let it soak in for 24 hours. And go and top it up with a couple of additional squirts while it&rsquo;s soaking. Then to free it, you really need to start hitting it :(  Unscrew it as many turns as you are comfortable with. I don&rsquo;t think you want to splay the forks too far! Support the quick release side fork leg and hammer on the maxle from the opposite side. Preferably with a soft faced mallet.</p></blockquote>

<p>Beating your hub and thru-axle with a hammer isn&rsquo;t the most comforting thing, but I had nothing to lose, so I gave it a try. The smart people on the forum were right. A 24 hour soak and several swings of the hammer did the trick.</p>

<p>The forum wasn&rsquo;t too clear on how hard you actually have to hit it—I <em>beat the hell out of the maxle</em> before it started to break free. It was unnerving. If you&rsquo;ve soaked it in penetrating oil long enough, though, just persevere and it will eventually yield.</p>

<p>They were also right about the races rusting to the maxle. The circumference of the spots on the axle where the races &lsquo;clamp&rsquo; around it can start to rust over time if you don&rsquo;t keep the assembly properly lubricated. Here&rsquo;s the detail of what that looks like:</p>
