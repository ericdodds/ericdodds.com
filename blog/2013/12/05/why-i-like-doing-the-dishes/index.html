<div class="entry-content"><p>I am the official Washer of Dishes in the Dodds household. Most every night before bed and every morning before I leave for work, I scrub, spray and wipe so that our kitchen is ready for the next meal.</p>

<p>Before we were married and lived in the same house, my wife and I had a great talk about who would be responsible for which chores, and I told her that I wanted to do the dishes because I enjoyed the job.</p>

<p>A few months into marriage my wife asked me an interesting question: &ldquo;I appreciate that you do the dishes all of the time, and I know that you said you like it, but why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t something that I&rsquo;d put much thought into before, but the answer came easily.</p>

<p>I like to clean the kitchen because most other areas of my life are battles that bring both joy and difficulty, whether it&rsquo;s a job or a relationship or staying in shape. Most will last as long as I&rsquo;m alive. All exhaust me at times. Doing the dishes is one of a few things that I can take care of completely—perfectly—in about 20 minutes (most nights). It&rsquo;s tactical, and every time I rub a drying cloth and put a dish away I can literally feel myself making progress.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong—I don&rsquo;t jump up and down at the chance to wield a fresh scrub brush. In fact, most times after a long day there are things I&rsquo;d much rather do than face the carnage of a hardware-heavy meal. But I <em>do</em> find deep satisfaction in starting and finishing a project quickly and flawlessly, even if the process isn&rsquo;t fun.</p>

<p>It turns out this process is really good for your brain because of something called Implicit Memory.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote><p>Implicit memory is a type of memory in which previous experiences aid in the performance of a task without conscious awareness of these previous experiences. Evidence for implicit memory arises in priming, a process whereby subjects are measured by how they have improved their performance on tasks for which they have been subconsciously prepared.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s utility in consistently feeling tangible progress and completeness, even if it&rsquo;s in something as simple as doing the dishes—especially if you don&rsquo;t feel like doing it. That small, low-cost push to wipe the stovetop eventually bleeds over into that project at work that needs that last 10% to go from good to awesome, or that special thing you&rsquo;ve been planning to do for someone that you can&rsquo;t seem to get around to.</p>

<p>Rewarding yourself with a scotch when you&rsquo;re done doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.</p>
