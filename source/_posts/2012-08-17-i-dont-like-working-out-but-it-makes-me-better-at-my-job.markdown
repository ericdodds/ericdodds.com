Let's get one thing straight: I'm a scrawny human being. Weights have never looked favorably on my lanky appendages, and even if they did I'd look like a freak with cantaloupe biceps. Despite the physiological cards I've been dealt, though, I still do strength training three times a week.

Recently my wife pointed out something she (and I) found interesting (we've been married 5 months so new discoveries abound): I don't have any specific goals for strength training. I'm not a fitness junkie, I don't have a need or desire to get super strong, I don't need to lose weight or change the way I look, and the health benefit isn't imperative - our lifestyle is filled with other aerobic activity several times a week (running, biking, hiking, etc.). So, understandably, she asked why I still train so consistently. Or, more bluntly, why would I put myself through pain when I didn't really need to?

Up until then, my thoughts on the subject hadn't traveled outside my own head, so synthesizing them and communicating them was an interesting exercise. My response went something like this:


> I think I work out because choosing to do something I really don't want to do, something that is consistently difficult and painful to overcome, makes the other battles in work and life easier to face and overcome.


In short, the battle of working out develops a fitness in difficulty that pays dividends when other battles happen at work and home.

Sure, I feel good after a workout, but I don't love heaving out pull ups or wincing through lunges. I do think, though, that the discipline of mind in hardship makes me a better employee, boss, and husband.

_(Well, that and the fact that I can still beat both of my brothers arm wrestling. I've never beat my dad, but time and age virtually guarantee a win at some point. Yes, that anticipation is clearly horrible and unfair, but family rivalries are family rivalries.)_
