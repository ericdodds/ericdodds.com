The last month has been a bit wild, what with [diving into a new industry](http://ericdodds.com/follow-your-procrastination/) and all. Here's what I've been up to:

—Building a workflow and project management system that works for our team.
_We've tried app after app, but the current system of [Trello](https://trello.com) + [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) + [Dispatch]("https://dispatch.io) + [Voxer]("http://voxer.com) seems to get the job done. Coming from a place where process was inflexible, working with a small team who's willing to change has been delightful._

—Organizing _everything_
_File here, file there, file, file everywhere! Grunt work, but important grunt work. I'm almost obsessive-compulsive about file structure and organization, and being able to build a clean and flexible structure from the beginning makes life oh-so-much easier._

—Setting up bank accounts, payroll, and health benefits

—Planning up-fit for two separate office locations, including layout and broad design
_Including designing a very cost-effective desk design using black pipe and fittings (like [this](http://theironyard.com/2012/11/its-time-to-take-a-stand-cowork-standing-desks/), but cheaper)_

—Researching investors and startups in the Southeast

—Attending the [GAN Founders Conference](http://theironyard.com/2012/11/what-the-iron-yard-learned-at-the-gan-founders-conference/) in Boston (and eating some really good food while I was there)

—Writing (for [GSA Business](http://www.gsabusiness.com) and [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/blog/))

—Dreaming with the [CoderDojo crew](http://coderdojogreenville.com) about teaching people more people to code

—Laying the groundwork for [Grok 2013](http://grok.cc)

—Re-branding The Iron Yard (coming soon to an internet near you)
_I had the chance to work with [Matthew Smith](http://twitter.com/whale) and [Justin Hall](http://dribbble.com/justinhall) to on the logo and visual elements (more on that soon), and I worked with Peter Barth to craft our positioning (more on that soon, too)._

—Building a content strategy, marketing, and PR plan for The Iron Yard

—Reading a good amount of tech news

—Brainstorming with the [RidePost](http://ridepost.com) crew about copy and user experience for a new feature

—Talking and writing with [Dan Waldschmidt](http://danwaldschmidt.com) on his new project

—[Walking a lot](http://daytum.com/displays/274600).

I work harder and come home happier than I ever have before.
