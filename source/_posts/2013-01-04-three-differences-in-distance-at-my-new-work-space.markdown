#### 1) Distance from home


My old job was about .6 miles from my house. I biked to work most days, and often told my wife that I was trying to enjoy a rare proximity to the office that I might not experience again. And then I went to work at The Iron Yard, and my _commute became even shorter_. 

To get from my front door to my desk takes approximately 5 and a half minutes on foot, or 755 steps, at a leisurely pace. It's so great that I almost feel bad telling you about it. Almost. 



#### 2) Distance to the water closet


This is petty, but the bathroom is a lot closer than it used to be. It's convenient. I drink a lot of water. Sue me. 



#### 3) Distance to coffee


Some people might argue that being close to coffee in the morning is a basic human right, but those people probably aren't human until they've had their coffee, so it doesn't matter. I really like coffee, and I have to walk almost 3 times further to get to it in the new office. That means I drink less of it, which means my teeth won't brown as quickly as I age. Inconvenient, but a win.
