This post is a bit 'off topic' for the other content on my blog, so here's a brief explanation:

*When I'm not working on the Internet, I like to take on analog activities like going to the mountains or working in my shop. Mountain biking has long been a favorite thing to do, and because I do all of my own maintenance, satisfies my interest in both adventure and mechanical things.*

*I ran into a problem with my bike earlier this year and couldn't find a solution anywhere I looked. I took a gamble with some penetrating oil and a hammer and turned out to be right. This post is for everyone who has or will face the same frustration.*

Not long ago I was changing the tires on my 2010 Specialized Pitch Pro. When I started to remove the Maxle from the Rockshox Pike (351) fork, it simply wouldn't come loose. Whenever I loosened it each side of the fork would spread apart—to the point where I thought I was going to break something. 

I do 99% of the work on my bike, but I conceded and took her to a shop to get a second opinion. After a few days of fruitless fiddling, the mechanic told me that he called the manufacturer, who said that the parts needed to be cut off, meaning I would lose the fork. I wasn't happy. 

Not satisfied, I turned back to the internet (which I had already scoured) and [a forum post](http://www.mtbpigs.co.uk/forum/index.php?topic=1715.0) that suggested: 

>The inner races of the bearings will have rusted onto the maxle.  Mine has tried to do this in the past. WD40 is an obvious start point (if you haven't been there already) you need to let it soak in for 24 hours. And go and top it up with a couple of additional squirts while it's soaking. Then to free it, you really need to start hitting it :(  Unscrew it as many turns as you are comfortable with. I don't think you want to splay the forks too far! Support the quick release side fork leg and hammer on the maxle from the opposite side. Preferably with a soft faced mallet. 

Beating your hub and thru-axle with a hammer isn't the most comforting thing, but I had nothing to lose, so I gave it a try. The smart people on the forum were right. A 24 hour soak and several swings of the hammer did the trick.

The forum wasn't too clear on how hard you actually have to hit it—I *beat the hell out of the maxle* before it started to break free. It was unnerving. If you've soaked it in penetrating oil long enough, though, just persevere and it will eventually yield. 

They were also right about the races rusting to the maxle. The circumference of the spots on the axle where the races 'clamp' around it can start to rust over time if you don't keep the assembly properly lubricated. Here's the detail of what that looks like:
