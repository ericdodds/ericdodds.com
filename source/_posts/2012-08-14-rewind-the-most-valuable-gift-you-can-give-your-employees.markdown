Since I launched the new site and told people that I'd actually write things,  I've spent time reviewing older articles I've written for [Brains on Fire](http://ericdodds.com/projects/brains-on-fire-internal/). I thought it might be an entertaining (and maybe even educational) exercise to re-post some of my younger ramblings now that I've convinced at least a few people that I've matured.

So, on that note, below is the first article I wrote as a professional in the real world. (I've edited out some of the superfluous fluff.)

<del>Tomorrow I'll post</del> (you can see my attempt [here](http://ericdodds.com/rewind-the-most-valuable-gift-you-can-give-your-employees-commentary/)) what I hope will be mature, growth-inspired commentary. No promises.


> “_The most valuable gift you can give your employees is permission to fail._”

When my friend [Joshua Blankenship](http://joshuablankenship.com/blog/) said that to me during my last term at university I didn’t fully understand what he meant, and to be honest, it didn’t settle well in my brain at first hearing.

I think part of my problem was that our society views failure primarily as a negative concept. Think about it – if you reflect on your education from kindergarten to university, most students have been taught through experience that the worst thing you could do as a student is fail. The famous red “F” with a circle around it at the top of your paper. I don’t think anyone is denying that earning high marks is generally a good thing and poor performance bears negative consequences, but what if our society’s view of failure is wrong? What if the red “F” is actually a healthy thing sometimes?

I was recently hired as part of the insight and research team here at Brains on Fire. Within the first few weeks on the job my boss, [Dr. Justine Foo](http://www.fastcompany.com/54084/fast-talk-voices-creative-front-lines), asked me to perform research and write a report for a national client. Though capable, I was green (still am), and in the fear of failure I learned so well through education, I began to ask her questions every 10 minutes about the project and what I should do (remember that Justine?).

After a few interruptions, she sat me down and gave me some of the best advice I have ever received: “_Eric, we didn’t hire you so that you would ask me a thousand questions and be unsure about what you are doing. We hired you to produce amazing work. And you are fully capable of doing that. So, if you have a legitimate question, ask me. If not, just produce amazing work. And if you get it wrong, I’ll show you where, why and how to fix it, and you’ll grow._”

Freedom.

The freedom to create my best work was born out of granted freedom to fail in my attempt.

Not cavalier freedom to do whatever I want, but freedom to give our clients the best (and most effective) work they have ever seen.

I have found that my greatest achievements are possible because my greatest failures are possible. So, you were right Joshua. I understand what you meant a lot better now.
