Lately I've been taking dedicated time to think through different areas of my lifeâ€”family, finances, spirtuality, etc. One area where I'm much less proactive than I'd like to admit is civic duty (a fancy way of saying I don't research my representatives or prepare for elections well). 

Many people my age (late 20s) are burned out on politics in general. The flow of constant, extreme polarization wears me out too. 

Frustrated or not, though, I live in a country where I can make my voice heard at the polls, and that's an incredible privilige. I'd be remiss not to take advantage of it. 

So, this year I decided to start by plotting out election dates on a calendar. There aren't many, but knowing they're on the horizen will help me do research and prepare to cast a vote. 

Interestingly, or maybe not, I struggled to find a well-done calendar of those dates (let me know if this resource exists). What I *really* wanted was an iCal or XML URL I could add to my calendar automatically. 

Even though there are only a handful of dates this year, I went ahead and added them to Google Calendar and made it public. I'll keep this updated for SC General Elections as well as Greenville, SC County elections and Greenville, SC Municipal Elections. 

Here's the calendar in...

- [iCal format](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/unaunjc6lsf3e2ddqktmmcm4k4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)
- [XML format](https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/unaunjc6lsf3e2ddqktmmcm4k4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic)
- [HTML link](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=unaunjc6lsf3e2ddqktmmcm4k4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York )

Hopefully this will help others like me keep better tabs on elections and who is representing me in Washington, South Carolina and Greenville.
