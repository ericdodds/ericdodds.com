We went to see the circus. The theme song was maddeningly repetitive, but the tightrope walkers made up for it.

Mike and Jeff's is a local pulled pork-favorite.

I traveled to San Francisco on business, and my wife came along to make a work-cation of it. The trees in the Music Concourse Community area of Golden Gate Park are veryÂ crustaceous.

If you haven't visited, the history lessons from Alcatraz (and the US prison system in general) are fascinating. Everyone loves a harrowing escape story.

What would Bill Murray do? A very valid question in the heart of the Mission District.

I happened upon free Carrie Underwood box seats, so I took my wife on a date. Not my favorite music, but the show was amazing entertainment, and Carrie has some serious pipes.

I finally conquered my first multi-pitch climb. This is a shot of my brother scaling the second section.

There's a large flat spot on Looking Glass Rock that climbers call the "Parking Lot." It makes for a great rest halfway up.

My lovely wife, basking in the glow of a bonfire.

We had a healthy does of April showers this spring.
