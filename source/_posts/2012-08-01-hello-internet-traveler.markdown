Hello there, Internet Traveler. 

My name is Eric Dodds, and you found the blog on my shiny new website. Here's the skinny: 

You can learn more about who I am [over here](http://ericdodds.com/about/). I enjoy writing and plan to post articles about stuff I find interesting - from company culture to technology to things I've learned doing project work at a [marketing agency](http://brainsonfire.com). Some people have told me I have a knack for the written word, but I'll let you be the judge of that. 

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to having you over again soon.
