I recently downloaded the much anticipated Mailbox app. It's a fine tool, designed well, with a pretty slick interface. Arguably, the most exciting feature of the product is it's ability to 'snooze' messages and bring them back at various intervals. Selling the idea of an easily attainable inbox zero made a lot of people salivate.

Hopefully the app helps people, but I don't think it will solve one of the real problems (especially for teams) that we have with email, which is the tendency to use it as a to-do list - the [primary reason creators gave](http://mailboxapp.com/story) for building the app.

People are hungry for help because of the volume of email they receive. The medium has grown from an efficient person-to-person communication tool to a firehose of unrelated information from any and every possible source (including physical devices). Lots of that information needs to be acted on, not just consumed. Figuring out how to deal with the constant stream can be a tall task.

Dealing with information and moving it around are two different things, though. Snoozing an email for a week is great, until you've snoozed it every week for a month straight. At that point you've given yourself a pat on the back for cleaning your inbox, when all you've done is temporarily hidden something you need to do.

Feeling good about hiding an email you need to act on is the same as feeling good about neatly labeling and filing past-due bills you need to pay.

Tools like Mailbox do a great job of helping you move things around in a logical, efficient way. That's great for individuals who use email mostly on their mobile devices, but it's a far cry from [revolutionizing the tool itself](http://visualidiot.com/articles/mailappapp), especially for teams working on complex projects.

<del>The opportunity is so much larger than improving the moving process. We need tools that remove the manual labor associated with translating that information into the actions that move strategies forward and produce products and services. Right now that process is clunky, and the pain is magnified on mobile devices.</del>

<del>Apps that allow creation of to-do's via email are a step in the right direction, but still require some manual labor and processing. [Taskforce](http://www.taskforceapp.com/) is an interesting solution, but keeps email in the browser, and seems much less robust than Asana or Trello. (I'd love to hear about other solutions I haven't come across.)</del>

UPDATE:

Of course, this is the internet, and everything exists. Both [do.com](http://do.com) and [Producteev](http://www.producteev.com/) provide pretty slick Gmail gadgets that allow you to turn emails into tasks. 

The more I've heard people talk about the Mailbox app, the more I've noticed complaints that "it screwed up Gmail on my computer." The aggravated users are referring to labels, and the specific way in which Mailbox uses them to categorize messages. Even though there was an explanation in the onboarding process, I've run across a surprising number of people who deleted the app because the user flow didn't translate well between mobile and desktop.
