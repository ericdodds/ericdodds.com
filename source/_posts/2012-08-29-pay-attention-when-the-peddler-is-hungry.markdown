A few months ago I had the chance to talk with a subsidiary of the company [Autodesk](http://usa.autodesk.com). A representative contacted me about co-promotion, and even though my gut told me our budget restraints would end the conversation quickly, I humored the opportunity.

The offer was surprising: promote our project to their gigantic audience for free.

Having entertained similar opportunities in the past, the one-sidedness of the deal seemed odd. Nonetheless, the potential benefit was attractive. So our team discussed, developed a low-impact test, and took a hopeful step forward. Throughout the process, my anecdotal research on Autodesk kept the peculiarity of the offer in the back of my mind - what would their seemingly successful business want with our relatively new (and small) project?

In the end, the trial showed that our audiences didn't align well. Despite more conversation, we stopped pursuing the relationship.

Then, the other morning, I read that Autodesk [is laying off a sizable number of employees](http://www.wired.com/design/2012/08/autodesk-layoffs/). Of course, the company's restructuring, forecasting, and falling stock issues may have nothing at all to with the odd opportunity we had. Even the if the potential of the relationship was realized it wouldn't have blipped on the radar screens of top brass.

Either way, the coincidence was a great reminder: pay attention when opportunity paints the peddler hungry.

_Speaking of paying attention to hunger, I would be remiss not to mention [Rice Bowls](http://ricebowls.org). They provide food to orphaned children, and I'm a proud supporter of their effort. _
