Last week my wife and I joined my parents for dinner at a fairly new restaurant on the lake. 

Aside from the privilege of enjoying a meal on the water, the experience was expected for a young establishment: decent service from a learning staff, and a well-prepared dish for a fair price.

When the manager came by to ask about our experience, he noticed that 5 people were waiting for a 6th person's meal to arrive before eating. Without any hesitation, he said: "_Your meal is on us. I apologize._" Upon return, our waiter was fully aware of the comped dinner and offered an additional apology.

Several days later I received a call from SCBT, my bank. The conversation was short: "_One of your checking accounts has been overdrawn. First, we wanted to know that you are a valued customer and this is abnormal, so we have waived the fee. We also want to let you know that you should transfer money into the account to avoid future fees._"

No inquiry about what happened, no discussion of the charge that overdrew the account, just a waived fee for a valued customer. No questions asked. 

The areas in which you serve people without requiring explanation reveals your standards as a company or professional. (Or person, for that matter.)

There will always be people who take advantage of superior service. But companies who resolve to have the highest standard of treatment have _already_ counted the cost of both their inevitable imperfection as well as the client's, and have built them into the business plan and employee culture.
