I really enjoy writing, and a few people have told me that I'm pretty good at it. I cover a variety of topics, and will happily write posts in response to questionsâ€”just <a href="mailto:eric@ericdodds.com?subject=I have a question, Mr. Dodds">send an email</a> to ask. 

You can peruse a fire-hose list of everything on my <a href="/blog">general blog feed</a>, or browse by category. 

<h1>Categories</h1>

<a href="blog/categories/julies-dreams/">Julie's Dreams</a> - my wife has wild dreams, and I record them 

<a href="blog/categories/work/">Work</a> - talk of business, motivation, productivity and the like

<a href="blog/categories/life/">Life</a> - happenings in the life of the Dodds family

<a href="blog/categories/adventures/">Adventures</a> - photo-based retelling of travels and such

<a href="blog/categories/nerdery/">Nerdery</a> - rare instances of me sharing useful code stuffs

<h1>Other places</h1>

Some people enjoy reading about the work I've done <a href="http://dontwaitfor.us/"> on my house</a>.

I'm responsible for almost all content on The Iron Yard's <a href="http://theironyard.com">website</a> and <a href="http://theironyard.com/blog">blog.</a>

In previous life I wrote <a href="http://www.brainsonfire.com/blog/author/eric/">over 160 articles</a> for a nationally respected creative shop. 

Ocasionally I freelance on select creative projects under the moniker Shy Volcano. I'm not currently available for work.
