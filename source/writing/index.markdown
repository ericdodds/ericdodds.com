<h1>Blog</h1>

You can peruse a fire-hose feed of posts <a href="/blog">on my blog</a>, or browse by category. I'll happily write posts in response to questionsâ€”just <a href="mailto:eric@ericdodds.com?subject=I have a question, Mr. Dodds">send an email</a> to ask. 

<h1>Categories</h1>

<h1>Other places</h1>

Some people enjoy reading about the work I've done <a href="http://dontwaitfor.us/">on my house</a> (yes, the images are broken and yes, I'm working on it). I'm responsible for almost all content on The Iron Yard's <a href="http://theironyard.com">website</a> and write consistently on their <a href="http://theironyard.com/blog">blog.</a> In previous life I wrote <a href="http://www.brainsonfire.com/blog/author/eric/">over 160 articles</a> for a nationally respected creative shop. 

Ocasionally I freelance on select creative projects under the moniker Shy Volcano. I'm not currently available for work.
